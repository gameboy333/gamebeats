A rhythm game made in Godot as a successor to one I made a few years ago.
## Info
The game is in pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha, so anything may change at any time.\
There is currently only one track and chart (Raise Up Your Bat by Toby Fox from Deltarune Chapters 3+4)
for testing the base gameplay (and since there aint a proper chart editor yet)\
\
Future plans include an in-game chart editor, chart events, and more!
## How to Play
Download the game at https://agameboy.itch.io/gamebeats and open the EXE.\
From there the game will start playing the song immediately, so get ready!\
The game basically plays out like DDR/FNF, where you gotta hit the notes at the correct time and get the highest score.\
(The chart should feel like a Normal/Hard FNF chart for an average player)\
Have fun!
### Controls
DFJK for left, down, up, and right arrows in that order. These will be rebindable in a further update.
